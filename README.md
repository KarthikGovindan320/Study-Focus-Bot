# Study-Focus-Bot

## Overview
This project is mainly meant for **personal use**, so I did not focus heavily on building a polished UI.  
However, I am open to suggestions and feedback to improve it further!

I often find it difficult to stay focused on academic tasks — especially when they are:
- Too uninteresting
- Too difficult
- Too easy
- Or when deadlines are too far away

Relying solely on motivation wasn't sustainable for me. Although I truly wanted to be more dedicated, accessible distractions made it hard.

Inspired by online at-home AI-proctored exams, I developed this **focus bot** to help myself stay concentrated during study sessions.

## Features
- **Facial Detection**:
  - Flags when I get distracted (i.e., when the face is not detected).
  
- **Break Monitoring**:
  - Tracks the number of breaks taken.
  - Monitors the total duration of breaks.
  - Maintains a study-to-break ratio over the past 5 hours.

## My Experience
I use this regularly, and it has significantly improved my ability to concentrate.  
Over time, it helped me become more detached from distractions — both with and without relying on this bot.

## Feedback
I am **eagerly accepting feedback and suggestions** to improve this project.  
Hope this tool helps you too!
